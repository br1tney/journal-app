# journal-app
Build me a journaling web application. Make it look simple yet aesthetic. Assume I have no technical expertise, so walk me through step-by-step. Criteria: Have a log-in page from Amazon Cognito. After logging in, you are met with a page where you are able to set the date, mood, and have a textbox to journal in. The textbox will save journal entries to a backend database in AWS. There must be a place where I can upload and paste a picture to the screen. Create 1 Dockerfile so that an image can be pushed to Amazon ECR, later being deployed on ECS and ALB + WAF. I should be able to access my website via my domain I had already registered through Route 53 (briitney.people.aws.dev) Paste all the code for me so that I am able to put it into my Github repository.
